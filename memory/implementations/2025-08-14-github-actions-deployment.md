## Implementation: GitHub Actions for Automated Deployment

## Summary: Successfully implemented and configured GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of the 3D Model Viewer to GitHub Pages.

## Details:
- **Workflow File:** Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to define the deployment pipeline.
- **Trigger:** Configured to trigger on `push` events to the `Dev-Git-Action` branch.
- **Steps:**
  - Checkout repository code.
  - Set up Node.js environment.
  - Install project dependencies (`npm install`).
  - Build the application (`npm run build`).
  - Deploy `dist` directory content to `Dev-Git-Action-Pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3`.
- **Permissions:** Granted `contents: write` permission to `GITHUB_TOKEN` to allow pushing to the deployment branch.
- **Base Path Configuration:** Updated `vite.config.js` to set the `base` path to `/3d-model-viewer/` for correct asset resolution on GitHub Pages.

## Outcome: Resolved persistent `gh-pages` caching issues and established a reliable automated deployment process.
