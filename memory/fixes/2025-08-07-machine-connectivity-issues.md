# 2025-08-07 Machine Connectivity Issues Blocking Development

## Problem
Sudden inability to connect to any localhost servers preventing application testing and debugging.

## Affected Services
- **Vite Dev Server**: ports 5173, 5174, 5175 - "Safari can't connect to the server"
- **Python HTTP Server**: port 8000 - Connection refused
- **Built Version**: File path issues due to GitHub Pages base config

## Timeline
- **Previous Session**: Servers worked normally
- **Current Session**: Complete localhost connectivity failure
- **Multiple Attempts**: Different ports, hosts (127.0.0.1), clearing cache
- **All Failed**: No localhost connections possible

## Symptoms
- Servers start successfully (log shows "ready" messages)
- Ports appear to be listening
- Browser cannot connect to any localhost address
- Both Safari and other browsers affected
- Network stack appears compromised

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Kill Processes**: `pkill -f vite`
2. **Clear Cache**: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
3. **Specific Host**: `--host 127.0.0.1 --port 3000`
4. **Python Server**: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
5. **Built Version**: Path issues due to Vite config

## Root Cause Assessment
Likely **network stack issues** requiring machine restart:
- macOS firewall changes
- Network configuration corruption
- Port binding conflicts
- Security policy changes

## Impact
- **Auto-hide debugging blocked**: Cannot test console output
- **Development workflow disrupted**: No live reload testing
- **Progress halted**: Critical functionality regression untestable

## Resolution Strategy
**Machine restart required** to reset network stack and restore localhost connectivity.

## Prevention
- Test network connectivity before major debugging sessions
- Have fallback testing methods (static file serving)
- Consider using external testing environments for critical debugging
