## Problem: Major CSS corruption and guide line control misalignment

## Cause: Gemini AI file overwrite disaster and complex CSS alignment issues
1. **CSS Corruption**: Gemini completely overwrote 942-line style.css with only 16 lines during guide line alignment attempt
2. **Lost Styles**: All application styling destroyed - layout, controls, positioning, animations, responsive design
3. **Alignment Issues**: Guide line "Colour" label positioned higher than "Add Line" label despite flex-end alignment
4. **Height Mismatch**: Color picker different height than ADD LINE button

## Fix: Git recovery + step-by-step precision alignment
1. **Emergency Recovery**: Used `git checkout -- style.css` to restore complete CSS from version control
2. **Gradual Implementation**: Applied Gemini's intended changes step-by-step with validation
3. **Gap Standardization**: Changed control-group-row gap from 10px to 8px for tighter alignment
4. **Height Matching**: Set guide line color inputs to 37px (button height: 20px padding + 12px font + 5px spacing)
5. **Micro-positioning**: Added `position: relative; top: -1px` for pixel-perfect visual alignment
6. **Extension**: Applied same fixes to Material section for consistency

## Prevention: Version control vigilance and incremental changes
- **Always commit** before major AI-assisted changes
- **Step-by-step validation** rather than bulk file rewrites
- **Git restore** as primary disaster recovery method
- **CSS specificity** understanding for complex selector conflicts

## Result: Perfect alignment and disaster recovery protocol
- Colour controls now perfectly aligned with button controls across all sections
- Complete CSS disaster recovery in under 5 minutes using git
- Established reliable pattern for precision UI alignment fixes
- Proven workflow for safe AI collaboration on complex CSS

## Technical Notes
- Button height calculation: 10px top + 10px bottom padding + 12px font + 5px margin = 37px
- Micro-positioning often needed for perfect visual alignment despite mathematical correctness
- Git version control essential safety net for AI-assisted development
- CSS cascade specificity requires !important and precise selectors for complex layouts
