# 2025-08-10 DAE Scene Traversal Bug Fix

## Problem
.dae files not loading after implementing line object removal - loadDAEModel() function failing silently.

## Root Cause
**Scene Tree Modification During Traversal**: Removing child objects during `traverse()` operation corrupts the iteration process.

## Technical Details
**Problematic Code**:
```javascript
collada.scene.traverse((child) => {
    if (child.isLine || child.isLineSegments) {
        child.parent.remove(child); // ❌ Modifying tree during traversal
    }
});
```

**Issue**: `traverse()` maintains internal iteration state that gets corrupted when objects are removed mid-iteration.

## Fix Applied
**Collect-Then-Remove Pattern**:
```javascript
// Phase 1: Collect objects to remove (safe during traversal)
const lineObjectsToRemove = [];
collada.scene.traverse((child) => {
    if (child.isLine || child.isLineSegments) {
        lineObjectsToRemove.push(child);
    }
});

// Phase 2: Remove collected objects (after traversal complete)
lineObjectsToRemove.forEach((lineObject) => {
    if (lineObject.parent) {
        lineObject.parent.remove(lineObject);
    }
});
```

## Prevention
**Three.js Best Practice**: Never modify scene graph structure during `traverse()` operations
- **Collect Phase**: Identify objects during traversal
- **Modify Phase**: Apply changes after traversal completes
- **Alternative**: Use `children.slice()` to create safe iteration copy

## Architectural Impact
This pattern applies to all scene tree modifications:
- Object removal during traversal
- Adding children during iteration
- Material swapping that affects hierarchy
- Any structural scene graph changes

## Related Patterns
Similar issues can occur with:
- DOM tree modification during iteration
- Array modification during forEach/map operations
- Any data structure modification during active iteration
