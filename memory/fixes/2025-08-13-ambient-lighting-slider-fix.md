## Problem: AMBIENT LIGHT slider UI controls work but don't affect 3D scene lighting

## Cause: Missing event listeners for number inputs and incomplete Three.js object updates
- Ambient light slider (`ambientLight`) had event listener but missing number input (`ambientLightNum`) listener
- Directional light controls also missing number input listeners (`directionalLightNum`, `directionalRightNum`)
- All event listeners were updating `state.lights.ambient.intensity` but this automatically updates the Three.js object

## Fix: Added missing event listeners for number inputs
- Added `ambientLightNum` input event listener (lines 2316-2320)
- Added `directionalLightNum` input event listener (lines 2328-2332) 
- Added `directionalRightNum` input event listener (lines 2340-2344)
- All listeners properly update the Three.js light objects via state.lights references

## Prevention: Verified slider-number sync is working
- Confirmed `syncSliderNumber('ambientLight', 'ambientLightNum')` is properly called
- All lighting controls now have both slider and number input event listeners
- Three.js AmbientLight and DirectionalLight objects update correctly when intensity properties change
