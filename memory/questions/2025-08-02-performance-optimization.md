## Status: OPEN
## Q: What are the next performance optimization targets for the 3D Model Viewer?
## Context: 
Current application performs well but with growing feature set and file size support, we should identify optimization opportunities before they become bottlenecks.

## Current Performance Characteristics:
- File limit: 50MB
- Load timeout: 30 seconds
- Render loop: requestAnimationFrame
- Memory management: URL cleanup, automatic compression

## Potential Optimization Areas:
1. **Model Loading**: Progressive loading for large files
2. **Texture Optimization**: Automatic texture compression
3. **Render Performance**: LOD (Level of Detail) systems
4. **Memory Usage**: Model caching and disposal strategies
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Web Workers for heavy computations

## Investigation Needed:
- Profile current memory usage patterns
- Identify largest performance bottlenecks
- Test with various model sizes and complexities
- Monitor real-world usage patterns

## Answer: [To be determined through profiling and testing]
