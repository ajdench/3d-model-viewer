## Q: What additional automation opportunities exist in the 3D Model Viewer development workflow?
## Context: 
With claude-dementia v3.0 now fully integrated and basic automation tools tested, we need to identify the next optimization opportunities for development efficiency.

## Options Considered:
1. **Git Hook Integration**: Auto-run pattern detection on commits
2. **Automated Testing**: Set up testing automation for model loading scenarios  
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Automated performance regression detection
4. **Feature Flag System**: Automate sunset feature management
5. **Documentation Sync**: Auto-update README/docs based on memory changes

## Investigation Areas:
- Current manual bottlenecks in development workflow
- Repetitive tasks that could benefit from automation
- Quality gates that could be automated
- Developer experience improvements through tooling

## Answer: [To be filled when investigation complete]
