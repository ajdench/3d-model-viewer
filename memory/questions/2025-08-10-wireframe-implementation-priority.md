# 2025-08-10 Wireframe Implementation Priority Question

## Status: OPEN

## Q: Which wireframe toggle implementation approach should be prioritized for the 3D Model Viewer?

## Context
User discovered .dae files display with white wireframe lines due to line objects. Current implementation removes these lines. Three implementation options identified with varying complexity and benefits.

## Options Analyzed

### Option 1: Simple Global Wireframe Toggle (2 hours)
- **Scope**: Universal wireframe mode using Three.js material.wireframe
- **Benefits**: Works on all formats, leverages existing patterns, immediate value
- **UI**: Material section, next to COMPLEX button
- **Complexity**: 4/10 - Simple to implement

### Option 2: DAE-Specific Edge Toggle (3 hours)
- **Scope**: COLLADA line object visibility control  
- **Benefits**: Preserves original edge information, format-aware optimization
- **UI**: Conditional controls when DAE loaded
- **Complexity**: 5/10 - Moderate implementation

### Option 3: Advanced Display Modes (6+ hours)
- **Scope**: Comprehensive visualization system (solid, wireframe, points, hybrid)
- **Benefits**: Professional 3D visualization capabilities
- **UI**: New DISPLAY section with multiple controls
- **Complexity**: 7/10 - Significant implementation

## Implementation Considerations

**User Value Priority**:
1. Global wireframe provides immediate utility for all file formats
2. DAE-specific edges address original issue but limited scope
3. Advanced modes provide professional features but high complexity

**Technical Integration**:
- All options leverage existing state management and UI patterns
- Global wireframe requires minimal code changes
- Advanced modes require new UI section and extensive logic

**Development Resources**:
- Option 1: Quick wins, immediate user value
- Option 2: Targeted solution, moderate effort
- Option 3: Long-term feature development project

## Strategic Questions

1. **User Priority**: Do users need wireframe for all formats or just COLLADA edge preservation?
2. **Development Focus**: Should effort go toward quick universal features or format-specific optimizations?
3. **Professional Features**: Is advanced visualization a priority for the application's target users?
4. **Implementation Sequence**: Should options be implemented incrementally or focus on one approach?

## Recommended Decision Framework

**Phase-Based Approach**:
1. **Immediate**: Option 1 (Global Wireframe) - High value, low effort
2. **Medium-term**: Option 2 (DAE Edges) - Complete COLLADA support
3. **Long-term**: Option 3 (Advanced Modes) - Professional visualization

**Single Focus Approach**:
- Choose based on primary user needs and development capacity
- Global wireframe provides broadest immediate benefit

## Answer: [Pending user decision]

## Decision Impact
Choice will influence:
- UI design direction (minimal changes vs new sections)
- Code architecture (simple toggles vs comprehensive display system)  
- Future feature development path (incremental vs revolutionary changes)
- User experience focus (universal utility vs format specialization)
