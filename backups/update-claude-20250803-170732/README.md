## 	üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project has been refactored for robustness and offline deployment.

*   **Self-Contained:** All dependencies, including the Three.js library, are bundled into the application. It does **not** require an internet connection to run.
*   **Build Process:** The project uses **Vite** as a build tool to bundle and optimize all assets (JavaScript, CSS).
*   **Modular Code:** The codebase is organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`) and uses modern ES6 modules.
*   **Reliable Loaders:** The old custom 3D model parsers have been replaced with the official, battle-tested `OBJLoader` and `STLLoader` from the Three.js library, ensuring better compatibility and performance.

## 	üöÄ Installation and Usage

An internet connection is required for the initial setup (to download dependencies). After the build step, the application is fully offline-capable.

### 1. Installation

First, clone the repository and install the required `npm` dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-model-viewer.git
cd 3d-model-viewer

# Install dependencies (requires internet)
npm install
```

### 2. Development

To run the application in a local development environment with hot-reloading:

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a server and provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use the provided shell script to start the server and open the browser automatically:

```bash
./start-dev.sh
```

### 3. Building for Production (Offline Deployment)

To create a self-contained, production-ready build:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

This command creates a new `dist` directory. This directory contains your entire application, fully optimized and with all dependencies included.

### 4. Deployment

Copy the contents of the `dist` directory to your private web server. The application is now ready to be served and will work without an internet connection.

## 	üõ†Ô∏è Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies
- **Three.js**: 3D rendering and scene management (managed via npm).
- **Vite**: Modern frontend build tool for development and bundling.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)**: No framework dependencies.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Hardware-accelerated graphics.
- **CSS3**: Modern styling.
- **localStorage API**: Client-side data persistence for presets.

## 	üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Models appear too small or large**
A: The auto-scaling system should handle this, but you can adjust `targetSize` in `centerAndScaleModel()` in `main.js`.

**Q: Browser shows security errors when running locally**
A: Ensure you are using the `npm run dev` command to start the Vite development server, rather than opening the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

**Q: Preset loading fails**
A: Check your browser's developer console for localStorage errors. Private or incognito browsing modes may disable localStorage.

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Models**: Consider decimating complex models before uploading them.
- **File Size**: A 50MB limit is enforced, but smaller files will always load faster.
- **Browser Performance**: Close other tabs or resource-intensive applications if you experience slowdowns.
