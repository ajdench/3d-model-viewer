## Internal Automation and Memory Management

### Memory Management System

Claude-dementia v3.0 compressed memory system with 10,000 token budget optimized for Claude Code workflows.

#### Core Architecture
```yaml
Token Budget: 10,000 (Hard Limit)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md: 1,000 tokens (Core guide)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Active Memory: 3,000 tokens (Current work)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.md (Session updates & progress)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md (Task context & priorities)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reference Memory: 5,000 tokens (Stable patterns)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md (System design)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns.md (Code patterns)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions.md (Technical decisions)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Buffer: 1,000 tokens (Overflow space)
```

#### Session Protocol
**Every Session Start**: `cat memory/active/status.md memory/active/context.md`
**Load As Needed**: `cat memory/reference/[relevant-file].md memory/patterns/[pattern].md`

#### Memory Management Commands
```bash
# Core operations
./memory/update.sh "changes"     # Update with auto-compression
./memory/compress.sh             # Check usage and compress
./memory/weekly-maintenance.sh   # Auto-archive old content

# Quick access
grep -r "pattern" memory/        # Search all memory
cat memory/active/status.md      # Current status dashboard
```

### Python Automation Suite (`/scripts/`)

**üèÜ Highest ROI**: `session-logger.py` - Auto-generates session summaries from git commits
```bash
python scripts/session-logger.py  # Creates memory/current-session.md
# Time saved: 5-10 minutes per session
```

**Pattern Detection**: `pattern-detector.py` - Discovers reusable code patterns automatically
```bash
python scripts/pattern-detector.py  # Finds error handling, validation, API patterns
# Value: Builds pattern library without manual effort
```

**Question Management**: `question-tracker.py` - Prevents important questions from being forgotten
```bash
python scripts/question-tracker.py  # Reports open questions, reminds about old ones
# Value: Never lose important clarifications
```

**Memory Search**: `memory-search.py` - Fast weighted search across all memory files
```bash
python scripts/memory-search.py "error handling"
python scripts/memory-search.py "timeout" --type fix
# Value: Find previous solutions in seconds
```

**Central Orchestration**: `memory-assistant.py` - Single interface to all tools
```bash
python scripts/memory-assistant.py start  # Session start routine
python scripts/memory-assistant.py end    # Session end routine
python scripts/memory-assistant.py search "topic"  # Quick search
```

### Daily Workflow Integration
```bash
# Morning routine
python scripts/memory-assistant.py start
# Shows: unanswered questions, last session summary

# During development
python scripts/memory-search.py "cors error"  # When hitting familiar problems

# End of session
python scripts/memory-assistant.py end
# Runs: session logger, pattern detector, question check, index rebuild
```

**Time Saved**: 5-10min/day (documentation) + 10-30min/incident (search) + hours/month (patterns)
**Quality Improvements**: Consistent documentation, growing pattern library, no lost context

This project is a self-contained 3D model viewer that has been refactored to run in an offline environment. It uses Vite for development and bundling.

### Core Technologies
- **JavaScript Framework**: None (Vanilla JS)
- **3D Library**: Three.js (managed as an npm dependency)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Development Commands
- **Run Development Server**: `npm run dev`
- **Create Production Build**: `npm run build`
- **Run Development Server and Open Browser**: `./start-dev.sh`

### Branching Strategy
- **`main`**: The primary branch for production-ready code.
- **`gh-pages`**: The branch for production deployments via GitHub Pages.
- **`Dev-2`**: The primary development branch for new features and bug fixes.
- **`gh-pages-dev-2`**: The branch for development deployments, allowing for a separate, live staging environment.

### Git Workflow
When asked to "Update Git", I will follow this process:
1.  **Review Code:** Analyze the codebase for the latest changes.
2.  **Update Gemini Files:** Update `GEMINI.md` and `gemini-code-changes.md` with any new information or changes.
3.  **Read Claude Files:** Read `CLAUDE.md` and `claude-code-changes.md` for context and understanding, but do not modify them.
4.  **Update README:** Update `README.md` with any relevant changes.
5.  **Git Status:** Run `git status` to review all changes.
6.  **Commit:** Create a commit message, get user approval, and then run `git add .` and `git commit`.
7.  **Push to Dev:** Push the changes to the `Dev-2` branch with `git push origin Dev-2`.
8.  **Deploy to Staging:** Deploy the `Dev-2` branch to the `gh-pages-dev-2` branch.
9.  **Confirmation:** Announce when the process is complete.


### Key Architectural Points
- The application is built into a `dist` directory for production deployment.
- All dependencies, including Three.js and its loaders, are bundled. There are no external CDN calls.
- The code is structured with ES6 modules (`import`/`export`).
- Main application logic is in `main.js`.
- Styles are in `style.css`.
- The `index.html` file is the main entry point.

### Project Documentation
This project maintains a detailed history of changes and development decisions in the following files:

*   **`claude-code-changes.md`**: A log of manual code modifications.
*   **`gemini-code-changes.md`**: A log of changes made by the Gemini assistant.
*   **`CLAUDE.md` & `GEMINI.md`**: Comprehensive internal documentation and development guidelines.
*   **`audit.md`**: A comprehensive review of the project's code maturity, architecture, security, and dependencies.
*   **`install.md`**: Instructions for deploying the application on a private, offline web server.

### Features
- **Model Loading**: Supports `.obj`, `.stl`, `.gltf`, `.glb`, and now `.dae` file formats. Models can be loaded via a file input or drag-and-drop.
- **Model Selection**: A dropdown menu allows users to switch between several built-in models (Torus Knot, Cube, Sphere, Pyramid).
- **Example Models**: Buttons to load example models like the Utah Teapot and Suzanne Monkey.
- **Camera Controls**: Sliders and number inputs for adjusting the camera's position (X, Y, Z) and rotation (X, Y, Z).
- **Model Controls**: Sliders and number inputs for adjusting the model's rotation (X, Y, Z) and advanced aircraft-style controls for Yaw, Pitch, and Roll.
- **Material Properties**: Controls for adjusting the model's material, including color, metalness, roughness, and transparency.
- **Lighting**: 
  - Sliders to control the intensity of ambient and directional lights.
  - An interactive 2D control pad to visually adjust the X/Y position of the directional lights.
- **Guide Line Overlay**: A configurable 2D overlay line with adjustable thickness, color, transparency, angle, and vertical position. It remains fixed in the viewer, independent of 3D scene movements, and is excluded from image captures.
- **Presets**: Users can save and load their own presets for camera, model, material, and lighting settings.
- **Reset Functionality**: Buttons to reset the camera and model to their default states.
- **Responsive Viewer**: The 3D viewer resizes to fit its container.
- **Image Capture**: Save a 2D PNG image of the current model view to a file with a transparent background. (Clipboard functionality is currently disabled due to technical issues.)

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **VIEW STATUS Panel**: The coordinate and model name displays have been redesigned into uniformly sized and aligned white boxes for a cleaner, more organized appearance.
- **Controls Panel**: The main title has been standardized, and redundant sub-headings have been removed for a more streamlined look.
- **Drag-and-Drop Text**: Updated to "_Drag-and-drop_ your 3D model here" for improved clarity.

### Sunset Features
- **Zoom Control**: The dedicated "Zoom" slider and its corresponding display in the "VIEWER STATS" panel have been removed. The camera's Z-position, controlled by the mouse wheel, now serves as the primary zooming mechanism, providing a more intuitive and standard user experience. The underlying code has been commented out for potential future reference.
- **Control Scheme**: The legacy "Model-centric" control scheme has been removed to simplify the user experience. The application now exclusively uses the "Standard (Camera-centric)" control scheme.

### Known Issues
- The `handleResize` function was missing, causing an error during viewer initialization. This has been fixed by adding the function to `main.js`.
- The "Viewer Stats" and "Interaction Controls" dialogs were restyled for consistency.
- The mouse controls were updated to remove middle-click functionality and reassign right-click to panning.
- A right directional light was added to provide more control over model lighting.
- **CSS Deprecation Warning**: The `slider-vertical` appearance property is deprecated. This has been addressed in `style.css`.
- **Recurring Build Failures**: Persistent `TypeError: Identifier "..." has already been declared` errors during `npm run build` due to duplicate function definitions in `main.js`. This is currently being addressed programmatically.

### Web App Rendering Fault (August 7, 2025)
- **Problem**: The web application failed to render after an attempt to fix deployment issues by changing asset paths in `index.html` from absolute to relative.
- **Root Cause**: The change from `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css?v=..."` to `<script type="module" crossorigin src="./assets/index-DrNG4NvB.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="./assets/index-D3boxNoJ.css">` in `index.html` caused the web app to stop rendering correctly.
- **Resolution**: The problematic changes in `index.html` were immediately reverted to restore the web app's rendering functionality.

### Deployment Issues (gh-pages-dev)
- **Problem**: `npm run deploy-dev` (using `gh-pages`) reported success, but the `gh-pages-dev` branch on GitHub remained empty.
- **Root Cause**: 
    1. `npm run build` was failing due to incorrect asset paths in `index.html` (hardcoded absolute paths like `/3d-model-viewer/assets/...`).
    2. The `gh-pages` package itself seemed to have issues pushing to an existing remote branch reliably, even after clearing its cache.
- **Resolution**: 
    1. Corrected asset paths in `index.html` to be relative (`./assets/...`).
    2. Modified `vite.config.js` to use a relative base path (`./`).
    3. Implemented a robust manual Git push process using an orphan branch (`git checkout --orphan`, `git --work-tree`, `git push --force`) to directly push the `dist` folder's contents to `gh-pages-dev`.

## Major Changes (v2.4+)

### Lighting Controls Redesign (v2.4)
- **Compact Layout**: Redesigned LIGHTING CONTROLS panel with compact, integrated layout.
- **Vertical Sliders**: Left and Right directional light controls positioned as vertical sliders.

- **Mathematical precision**: Ensured pixel-perfect alignment through precise calculations.

### Multiple Guide Lines (v2.10.1)
- **Dynamic Guide Lines**: Users can now add and remove multiple, independent guide lines.
- **Independent Controls**: Each guide line has its own collapsible control pane with independent settings for color, thickness, transparency, angle, and position.
- **Dynamic UI**: The UI dynamically adds and removes control panes as lines are created or deleted, with titles that update automatically.

### Control Synchronization (v2.11.0)
- **`ControlSync` Class**: A new modular and robust system for synchronizing UI controls (e.g., sliders and number inputs).
- **Centralized Management**: Replaces scattered `addEventListener` calls with a centralized registry, improving maintainability and reducing errors.
- **Advanced Features**: Supports bidirectional synchronization, value validation, and custom callbacks.

## Strategic Development Roadmap
- **`claude-todo.md`**: A new file outlining the strategic roadmap for the project.
- **Modularization**: The primary focus is on refactoring the monolithic `main.js` into smaller, reusable modules.
- **Core Architecture**: The next phase involves creating `StateManager`, `EventManager`, and `ResourceManager` classes to form a solid architectural foundation.

## Evidence-Based Debugging Protocol

A fundamental shift in development methodology, prompted by the "syncSliderNumber Crisis," where a critical runtime error was missed during theoretical code analysis.

**Core Principle**: Prioritize real-time, observable evidence (browser console errors) over assumptions about code behavior.

### The Protocol
1.  **üö® Runtime Verification First**: Always test the application's actual behavior in a browser before analyzing code structure. A successful build does not equal a functional application.
2.  **üîç Browser Console Priority**: User-reported error messages and live console output are the most valuable sources of debugging information.
3.  **‚ö° Function Accessibility Checks**: Before debugging complex logic, verify that the functions involved are accessible in the global scope and have not been inadvertently nested or duplicated.
4.  **üéØ Initialization Check**: Confirm that the application initializes completely without errors before investigating issues in specific features.
5.  **üìä Evidence Over Theory**: What the application *is actually doing* is more important than what the code *should be doing*.

## Current Status (August 9, 2025): Project Audit Complete

A full codebase audit has been completed, and the results have been documented in `audit.md`. The project is stable, and the next phase of development will focus on implementing a testing framework and refactoring the codebase into a more modular architecture, as outlined in the project's strategic roadmap.

## Comprehensive Remediation Plan (2025-08-06)
