### 2025-08-08 - GIT PROCESS ENHANCEMENT

**[2025-08-08] [PROCESS] [AUTOMATION]**: Enhanced the "Update Git" process to include dedicated change logs for both Claude and Gemini.
- **Files**: `claude-code-changes.md`, `gemini-code-changes.md`
- **Impact**: Establishes a formal, dual-track change logging system. Gemini now maintains its own log, and a new entry was added to `claude-code-changes.md` to initialize it.

  - Interrupted build/deployment process leaving repository in inconsistent state
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Completed build process generating consistent asset files
  - Successfully merged directional arrows implementation from temp branch
  - Cleaned up all temporary branches (4 branches deleted)
  - Verified vite.config.js base path configuration
- **Files**: Branch cleanup, build artifacts, git history consolidation
