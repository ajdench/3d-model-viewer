### 2025-08-08 - BRANCHING REFACTOR

**[2025-08-08] [PROCESS] [GIT]**: Created new `Dev-2` and `gh-pages-dev-2` branches to resolve persistent deployment issues. The old `Dev` and `gh-pages-dev` branches were deleted.
- **Files**: `GEMINI.md`, `gemini-code-changes.md`, `README.md`
- **Impact**: Resolved a critical deployment blocker and established a clean branching structure for future development. The primary development branch is now `Dev-2` and the staging deployment branch is `gh-pages-dev-2`.

### 2025-08-08 - GIT PROCESS ENHANCEMENT

**[2025-08-08] [PROCESS] [AUTOMATION]**: Enhanced the "Update Git" process to include dedicated change logs for both Claude and Gemini.
- **Files**: `claude-code-changes.md`, `gemini-code-changes.md`
- **Impact**: Establishes a formal, dual-track change logging system. Gemini now maintains its own log, and both are included in all future commits. This improves transparency and debugging by clearly attributing changes to either the user (via Claude) or the assistant (Gemini).
- **Gemini Task ID**: 20250808-update-git-process
