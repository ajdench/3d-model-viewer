## What is this?

The **3D Model Viewer** is a professional web application that lets you view, interact with, and customize 3D models directly in your browser. Think of it as a powerful, easy-to-use tool for exploring 3D files without needing expensive software.

## What can you do with it?

### ðŸŽ¯ **Load Your Models**
- **Drag and drop** your 3D files directly into the viewer
- **Supports popular formats**: .obj, .stl, .gltf, .glb, .dae
- **No file size limits** for most typical models
- **Instant loading** with visual feedback

### ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls**
- **Rotate models** by clicking and dragging
- **Zoom in/out** with your mouse wheel
- **Pan the camera** with right-click and drag
- **Focus on models** with the F key
- **Reset views** with double-click actions

### ðŸŽ¨ **Customize Appearance**
- **Change colors** with easy color pickers
- **Adjust materials** - make things shiny, rough, or transparent
- **Control lighting** - position light sources for the perfect view
- **Add guide lines** to measure or reference parts of your model

### ðŸ’¾ **Save Your Work**
- **Save scenes** with all your customizations
- **Load previous setups** instantly
- **Create presets** for common configurations
- **Capture screenshots** of your models

### ðŸ”§ **Professional Features**
- **Multiple transparency modes** for complex models
- **Advanced lighting controls** with directional indicators
- **Real-time orientation widget** showing model position
- **Responsive interface** that works on any screen size

## Who is this for?

- **3D Artists** reviewing their work
- **Engineers** inspecting CAD models  
- **Students** learning about 3D modeling
- **Hobbyists** sharing 3D prints
- **Anyone** who wants to view 3D files easily

## Technical Information

### Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-model-viewer.git
cd 3d-model-viewer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

### Architecture

**Professional 3D Model Viewer** built with Three.js r179. Single-page web application with interactive controls for camera, models, materials, lighting, and guide lines. Uses ES6 modules + Vite, deploys to GitHub Pages.

#### Core Structure
- **Files**: `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css` (cleanly separated)
- **State**: Global `state` object manages all scene components
- **Event-Driven**: UI controls with real-time 3D updates
- **ES6 Modules**: Vite development + bundling

#### Key Systems

**Scene**: Transparent background, perspective camera (50Â° FOV), WebGL renderer with antialiasing
**Lighting**: Ambient + dual directional lights, compact vertical sliders, Basic/Complex modes
**Models**: Built-in torus model + file upload (OBJ/STL/GLTF/GLB/DAE)
**Controls**: Left-drag=rotate model, right-drag=pan camera, wheel=zoom
**Materials**: PBR with color/metalness/roughness/transparency (5 transparency modes)
**Presets**: Save/load complete configurations to localStorage
**Capture**: PNG download with transparent backgrounds
**Guide Lines**: Overlay with customizable appearance and position

### Browser Support

- **Chrome 88+** (recommended)
- **Firefox 84+** 
- **Safari 14+**
- **Edge 88+**

Requires modern browser with WebGL support and ES6 module capabilities.

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Organization
- **Functions**: Top-level scope, organized by feature (loading, controls, utilities)
- **Safety**: Use `safeSetValue()` and `safeAddEventListener()` for DOM operations
- **Modules**: ES6 imports for Three.js and loaders from examples
- **Material Updates**: Helper functions handle both single meshes and groups

#### Requirements
- **Browser**: Modern WebGL + ES6 modules support
- **Files**: 50MB upload limit, supports .obj/.stl/.gltf/.glb/.dae
- **Performance**: requestAnimationFrame, preserveDrawingBuffer for capture

### Recent Updates (v2.9.3+)

#### UI Excellence (Latest Session)
- **Borderless Design**: Applied comprehensive borderless aesthetic to all panels while preserving backgrounds and corner radii
- **Instructions Optimization**: Perfect width tuning (386px) with proper text alignment 
- **Lighting Controls**: Fixed click vs drag detection, corrected COMPLEX mode directional logic (in/out vs up/down)
- **Visual Consistency**: Unified design language across viewer container, controls panel, and all input elements

#### Major Features (v2.8-2.9)
- **Collapsible Controls** (v2.8): All 7 sections with smooth CSS animations, persistent state, accessibility
- **Upload Area Relocation** (v2.9): Moved to bottom-right with streamlined interface
- **Dependency Updates** (v2.9.2): Three.js r178â†’r179, Vite 7.0.5â†’7.0.6
- **External Surface Extraction** (v2.10.0): Hybrid architecture for high-poly model optimization
